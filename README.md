A project for my intro to programming class at NSCC. Enter an odd number, and a magic square with width and length of that number is generated. What makes it a magic square is that all rows, colums, and corner to corner diagonals all add up to the same amount. Generating the square is a basic algorithm where you mainly just move up and to the right, wrapping around to the opposite side and the end. Whenever you run into an existing number in the square, just move down one, then continue moving up and to the right.
